# Update 2019
Red Hat distributed container images are moving from registry.access.redhat.com to registry.redhat.io. The new registry access model requires you to have a Red Hat login. If you are a customer with entitlements to Red Hat products, you already have an account. This is the same type of account you use to log into the Red Hat Customer Portal (access.redhat.com) and manage your Red Hat subscriptions.

If you do not have a Red Hat account, you can get a free Red Hat account by signing up for one of the following:

* [Red Hat Developer Program](https://developers.redhat.com): Signing up for a free developer account gives you access to developer tools and programs.
* [30-day Trial Subscription](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-enterprise-linux/evaluation): Signing for a 30-day trial subscription gives you access to selected Red Hat software products.
